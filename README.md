##Merge Of Sorts
=====

###Algorithms Can Be Fun

This was simply a fun way to implement a Merge Sort. A shake gesture activates the sorting of 100 Game of Thrones characters by height.

###Things To Fix

- Cells should dynamically resize based on character's original image dimensions
- Animate the merge sort so the reshuffling is visible
